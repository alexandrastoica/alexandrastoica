### Hi there 👋 I'm Alexandra, a frontend and UX engineer 🦄

👩🏻‍💻 Currently diving into the world of Nextjs by rebuilding my [portfolio](https://github.com/alexandrastoica/portfolio). I'm exploring the new `appDir`, as well as playing with animation, hsl based color themes, and design system components.

You can also find me on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/alexandrastoica).
