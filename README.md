### Hi there 👋 I'm Alexandra, a frontend and UX engineer 🦄

👩🏻‍💻 Currently diving into the world of Nextjs by rebuilding my [portfolio](https://github.com/alexandrastoica/portfolio). I'm exploring the new `appDir`, as well as playing with animation, hsl based color themes, and design system components.

I also create rich experiences, such as [CoreLayr](https://www.corelayr.io/), from ideation, design, all the way to code ✨👩🏻‍🎨
